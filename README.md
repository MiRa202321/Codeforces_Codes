Hey there!
Welcome to my repository of codes. Maintaining such a repo is among my intial steps in the technical world of learning programming and getting handy with git and github too. 
You are here to see the codes, so let me guide you:

What's in this repo?
**This repo has the codes written in Java language.**
**These are the solved questions of Codeforces(https://codeforces.com/). It is among the best platforms to practise Competetive Coding.**
(**NOTE:** The names of the files are on the basis of the question.)


To find solution for the particular question, you are looking for, follow these steps:
1. Search for the file name with some similar keyword as in the problem.
 (It might be after the name of some character or approach or algorithm in the problem given on CodeForces platform.)
2. Open the file and the question id is commented at the beginning of each file.
3. Search if it same as the seeked problem.
4. if yes, then Hurray! Here is your solution in Java.(My approach of how I have solved that problem.)
5. If not found yet, then go to step 1.

Happy coding! Thank You for visiting this repository. :)
